These are my "successful" projects; if you want to see unsuccessful ones too, visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/p0lyw0lf).

## This Very Website
[website](https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/website)

Made using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator powered by Rust! Theme is my own.

## A Tool For You To Reboot Into Arch Linux From Windows
[windowsctl](https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/windowsctl)

This is very adapted for my dual-boot setup, which uses [systemd-boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot) as a bootloader. It can read UEFI variables to override what's in its configuration (which has Windows as the default), so I made a windows tool to edit those variables.

## A Discord Bot That Tells You How Long It Is Until Tuesday
[tuesdaybot](https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/tuesdaybot)

The concept of "Tuesday" is a running joke among my friends so I made this bot.

## A Tool To Edit Song Metadata So That iTunes Doesn't Complain
[p2_tagging](https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/p2_tagging)

I really forget why I named it this. Anyways I've been (mostly legally) downloading music to put into playlists, and found that a lot of the formatting on the metadata isn't consistent between platforms. Having my iPhone be the main place I care about metadata, and Spotify be the main place I care about getting songs from, I made a tool to automatically query Spotify song metadata and put it on a local file that's in a format iTunes can import. It started out as just a CLI app but I added a GUI since editing metadata that way is a lot easier.

## A Discord Bot That Filters Swears And Does Some Other Stuff Too
[Dotl-Bud](https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/DotL-Bud)

This bot is ***really old***. Like, I started it between Sophmore/Junior year of HS old. And yet, it still works fine (for now), helping moderate the discord for the [Daughter of the Lilies](https://www.daughterofthelilies.com/dotl/part-1-a-girl-with-no-face) webcomic, sending out page updates and having random image functionality too.

## Wait That's It?
Yeah I have some other cool projects associated with my irl identity but can't share them here for reasons :)
