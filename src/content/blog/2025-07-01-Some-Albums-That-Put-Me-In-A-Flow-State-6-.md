so. "flow state"? when I'm working on something, sometimes i need some extra energy to keep me going. something with a strong beat, not _too_ repetitive, simple lyrics if there are any, & preferably in the electronic genre. fortunately, there's a lot that fits this bill, and I keep finding it! i don't _have_ to publish these posts monthly, but hey if there's enough good music out there, i might as well right? reverse ranked order because i'm feeling spicy >:)

## 4: [Auvic – Voices Call](https://auvicmusic.bandcamp.com/album/voices-call-remastered)

That link is actually to the bandcamp remastered version, which doesn't contain all the songs seemingly? The original version on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/library/albums/l.grUydjq) version has many more (and being honest I am not super into the remastering anyways but i digress). That original version is very 2015 in its soundfont, makes me feel groovy, bouncing in my seat a little, saying "woo, yeah", etc.

I do not know genres very well but I will try my best: upbeat electro, inspired by chiptune in some ways, but mostly it's its own thing. Once again, very 2015.

Favorite track: 08 – Upgrades <audio controls src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0197b826-9f36-755a-bc29-f43e1627f9f9/Upgrades.mp3"></audio>[^1]

## 3: Virtual Riot – Simulation (Deluxe Version)[^2]

No bandcamp link, just an [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/library/albums/l.UMB2rW3) one sorry. The original is probably a more cohesive album, the only reason I include this one is because (a) more songs = more flow & (b) between Deluxe/non-Deluxe, it has my favorite song, so yeah :)

Virtual Riot has a long track record of releasing very good color bass (i think that's the right genre label?), [never let me down](https://soundcloud.com/dylantallchief/dylan-tallchief-crow-always-let-you-stop-virtual-riot-tribute) really, but that's all mostly in singles, so it's nice to get a full-length album from them to just plow through when I need that good good.

Favorite track: 17 – Bossfight Afterparty <audio controls src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0197bb3b-6df8-7ddb-b58d-b25685756593/Bossfight_Afterparty.mp3"></audio>

## 2: [Adam Tell – Peripheries](https://adamtellmusic.bandcamp.com/album/peripheries)

![Adam Tell – Peripheries album cover. watercolor of starry sky thru an opening in the trees](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0197b826-9f36-755a-bc29-f43e1627f9f9/peripheries.jpg>)

I mostly knew Adam Tell from his lyrical work/singing in [Superseded](https://music.apple.com/us/song/superseded/1171244991), [Falsework](https://adamtellmusic.bandcamp.com/album/falsework), & [Data Loss](https://jkuch.bandcamp.com/track/jkuch-adam-tell-data-loss). Turns out he can work those hardware synths too!! Bit darker than the other ones so far, but it's kind of like that starry night nighttime darkness, kinda cozy in a way at times.

Feels like it'd fit right at home in an [Explosions&Fire](https://www.youtube.com/@ExplosionsAndFire/videos) video during one of those chemistry montages , so I guess that puts it in the ambient genre? anyways

Favorite track: 01 – Transfer Orbit <audio controls src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0197bb3b-6df8-7ddb-b58d-b25685756593/Transfer_Orbit.mp3"></audio>

## 1: [free.99 – Out For Blood](https://xfree99x.bandcamp.com/album/out-for-blood)

![free.99 – Out For Blood. a bloody, distorted face with the album name overlaid](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0197b826-9f36-755a-bc29-f43e1627f9f9/out_for_blood.jpg>)

Trans Pride is over. now is the time for Trans Wrath /j

in all seriousness, this album is very angry. overall i am better off just choosing not to comprehend the lyrics[^3], treating the words as if they were from a foreign language instead, getting all i need to know from keywords/tone of voice. which is to say: get angry!

never fails to light a fire under me. however, because the concepts slide right off me, it is more "generic high energy" than "angry" for me at this point. still feels like a problematic fave, but whatever it's _my_ problematic fave, and you can't take it away from me :P

genre feels like highly produced rave music, if i had to describe it. very move-to-able.

Favorite track: 02 – Lilith <audio controls src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0197b826-9f36-755a-bc29-f43e1627f9f9/Lilith.mp3"></audio>

That's it for this month, hope you found something new you liked! Music is very important to me and I hope you enjoy it too <3

[^1]: I got the idea for this from Plum's [massive music list everyone should listen to](https://www.plumpan.net/main-blog/plums-music-everyone-should-listen-to), which has 30-second clips for every single one of the albums he recommends. I generate these clips with `ffmpeg -ss '00:mm:ss' -i 'input file.mp3' -t '00:00:30' 'output file.mp3'`, given the timestamp, input file, and output file I want to generate, and given that I already have the music downloaded ofc.
[^2]: Also, is it "Deluxe Version", or "Deluxe Edition"? The title and album cover can't seem to agree :P
[^3]: Being a bit dramatic here, it's not like the _most_ problematic stuff that's ever been sung, pretty tame by many standards, but it's getting up there. like i said, angry.
