This red one. Something about slopers where it pays to be flexible, & this corner, just clicks for me.

1. Post each hand on each starting hold, and put the right foot on the hold below the right starting hold
2. Right arm reaches to the left, grabs the hold to pull right, and use the post on the left arm to get the left foot on the hold below it's starting hold. This requires a little bit of flexibility.
3. Left hand matches the right, then the right goes up to the lower of the two holds between the start and the top four.
4. Left leg goes to starting hold, stand on it to make it straight, then right leg steps high to the lower of the holds on the right. This requires a fair amount of flexibility; I saw many others who could not do this like I did, but this felt good & worked for me.
5. Drop the left leg and really lean into the right leg & hand; physics dictates this position is quite stable. Left hand reaches up to the hold just above the right.
6. Right hand matches left, then left hand bumps once, twice. That second hold is good, and you can get your leg far over to the so-far-unused hold on the left.
7. Right matches left, left bumps, right matches again, now you're at the second to last hold. Left bumps a final time.
8. Right leg hooks the toe on the hold next to the left foot, right hand matches on final hold, it's stable enough to hang there, and you're done!

It's been a while since [my last V6](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2024-11-02-i-did-my-first-v6-boulder-today-/). I blame the holiday season. Fun to get back into it tho, I am still improving, and this did not feel like a fluke. Have my eye on a V7 but seems like it requires a lot more grip strength than I have at the moment... That is what I like in a climb, lots of big slopers that challenge ur balance & positioning instead.

Fun gym, got a good group of friends there by now, here's to [keeping my resolution](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2025-01-05-new-year-s-resolutions/)!
