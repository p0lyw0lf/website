Why doesn't the following code run? (comments represent different files):

```c++
// foo.hpp
template <typename T>
struct Foo {
  static void foo(void);
}
// foo.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "foo.hpp"
template <>
struct Foo<int> {
  static void foo() { std::cout << "foo\n"; }
}
// main.cpp
#include "foo.hpp"
int main(void) {
  Foo<int>::foo();
}
```

From [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3989435/why-do-i-get-missing-symbols-for-an-explicit-template-specialization-in-a-static). Basically, `foo.cpp` needs to be

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "foo.hpp"
template struct Foo<int>;
void Foo<int>::foo() { std::cout << "foo\n"; }
```

because otherwise, member function definitions are secretly `inline`, and since there is no usage site in the same compilation unit they won't get exported as symbols. Declaring them like this lets them be non-inline, and the symbol can be used in the other compilation unit.

hell language btw.
