another good manga by Inio Asano. follows a group of girls from middle school onwards as they navigate an ongoing alien invasion in Tokyo. i finished it today, really liked it up until the last volume, at which point it sorta became a parody of itself, pretty much solely in order to end at exactly chapter 100. i would still recommend it tho! lots of interesting ideas it presents and explores. there's even a trans girl in that image and you didn't realize
