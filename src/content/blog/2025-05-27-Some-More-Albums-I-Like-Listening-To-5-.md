As good a time to start numbering these as any :P You can find previous collections in my [#music](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/music/) tag. Without further ado, let's get into it!

## 1: [Amamelia - Bananamelia!](https://amamelia.bandcamp.com/album/bananamelia)

![single dew-wet leaf in front of a boxy rainbow & sky gradient](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019713f0-c9b3-7775-83a5-4752d66f6b08/IMG_9647.jpeg>)

[rykarn recommended this one](https://social.treehouse.systems/@rykarn/114431434221521450)!! from the artist page:

> Auckland based trans weirdo electronic breaks and house

so yeah, that's what it's all about, no wonder i enjoyed it :3

Compared to many other contemporary songs, the hooks on these aren't quite as strong, but in exchange, they hit a lot harder once you match yourself to their pace. Definitely worth listening to as a full album for that reason.

*Favorite track: 4. Colorbox*

## 2: [OK Go - Hungry Ghosts](https://paracadute.bandcamp.com/album/hungry-ghosts)

You all know them from their fantastic music videos, and I'll admit I was already familiar with many a track on this album thanks to those too. But! I just really like all the tracks on here?? Even the ones I haven't seen videos for before. These guys rock.

*Favorite track: 1. [Upside Down & Inside Out](https://youtu.be/LWGJA9i18Co)*

## 3: [Pedestrian Tactics - Nerds Trying To Dance EP](https://madzoo.bandcamp.com/album/nerds-trying-to-dance-ep)

A rare W for Apple Music algorithmic suggestions. Usually it feeds me "niche stuff I've already listened to" or "pop music that I don't particularly like", but once in a blue moon it'll hit me with the new stuff that I vibe with. Best part is, Pedestrian Tactics has an extensive catalog for me to go through, though so far this is my favorite EP of theirs. Slightly experimental electronic, extremely danceable.

*Favorite track: 2. Nerds Trying To Dance*

## 4: [Jamie Paige - Constant Companions](https://jamiepaige.bandcamp.com/album/constant-companions)

![An illustration of Jaime lays smiling on a picnic blanket next to an outline of a humanoid cat, basking in the sun](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019713f0-c9b3-7775-83a5-4752d66f6b08/IMG_9650.jpeg>)

I think I bought this album as a pre-order when I was listening to a lot of other Jaime Paige and then just... forgot about it?? Either that or fell to the bottom of my pile while waiting for the "perfect moment" to listen to it, after experiencing the sublime artistry of the [Machine Love](https://youtu.be/sqK-jh4TDXo) music video/album preview.

turns out the perfect moment is right after watching the [berd rots](https://youtu.be/h7an0I2yArw) youtube video and getting ROT FOR CLOUT stuck in my head. who else up ROTTING THEY CLOUT /j

Bit more of a "collection of songs" than an "album listening experience" than the other albums I mentioned, but still very good. It's Jaime Paige after all, so every song is lyrical & fun to listen to.

*Favorite Track: 3. ROT FOR CLOUT*

Oh yeah and update on [my last post](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2025-04-30-some-albums-i-am-looking-forward-to/): We Live In A Society was indeed p good, Track 1 is the most banger but The Ocean Is Fake is nice too, and unfortunately TOHO BOSSA NOVA 14 has not released on streaming services yet :( oh well
