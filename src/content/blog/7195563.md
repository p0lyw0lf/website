## I finally played [Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392820).

Great visual novel. The vibes are simply immaculate. Short game (~20min) but easily worth the (very cheap!) price of admission. idk why I procrastinated playing it for so long.

Will be interesting to see how the sequel, [Milk outside a bag of milk outside a bag of milk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604000), holds up in comparison.
