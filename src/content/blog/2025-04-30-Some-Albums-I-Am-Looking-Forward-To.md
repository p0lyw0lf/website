## Flume & JPEGMAFIA - We Live In A Society

![Album cover, presumably JPEGMAFIA & Flume hands in a handshake over a pure white background](https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019686c7-873d-7ee0-85a7-07f65a3561b2/IMG_9549.png)

I found out this was coming due to a [teaser video for the first track](https://youtu.be/lhVeE3N3Rcw). It's a bit crudely animated, but I think that was an intentional artistic choice to capture the transition from "meandering jam sesh with crazy discordant electronic noise" to "immaculately layered harmonics extracted from the best noise & ideas". I keep coming back to it for two reasons: the song they get to near the end is quite catchy & exactly my thing yes, but also I really like seeing that raw artistic process, really captivating even if it may have been a simulacra.

An [accompanying text post](http://youtube.com/post/UgkxB5iH1tU43LpjjNcsweom9kAYpz1QhYNN) lists the set at 4 tracks long, dropping May 2nd on presumably all major streaming services. That's quite soon, exciting!! All Flume stuff is worth a listen imo, even if I don't end up liking it :)

## Shibayanrecords - TOHO BOSSA NOVA 14

![Sakuya Izayoi from Touhou Project basking in a white-and-red moonlight, as the album cover](https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019686c7-873d-7ee0-85a7-07f65a3561b2/IMG_9550.webp)

This is a very conventional release, both for Shibayan and for Japanese music artists in general: [Crossfade](https://youtu.be/ZQtK3WALRJI) available as a whole-album sampler a week before release on May 5th, available for immediate preorder on [melonbooks](https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail/detail.php?product_id=2932209) if you live in Japan, and streaming internationally some indefinite time later.

Shibayan always releases a TOHO BOSSA NOVA album in May, every year for 14 years running now I guess. [I've mentioned before](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2025-02-16-some-albums-i-ve-been-listening-to-a-lot-recently/), and while #2 is so far my favorite, it is nice to have a yearly tradition to listen to something fresh yet familiar, nostalgic yet novel. Excited for this one too, hopefully I can hear it some time in May.

Usually I find a third album for things like this, but heh it's really only these two. Instead, here's two more already released albums I have not listened instead:

- [Aritus x FIBRE - Virtues EP (Deluxe)](https://neoncityrecords.bandcamp.com/album/virtues-ep-deluxe): Story goes that this was produced in they heyday of future funk, when high schoolers didn't quite know about music licensing, so now they finally figured out how to get the licensing for this remaster, neat!
- [greyl - SINGALS CHRONICLE 01](https://greyl.bandcamp.com/album/singlas-chronicle-01): u already know how i feel about greyl. i def gotta get this

Also, feel free to reach out with album recommendations of your own!! Comment links should be at the bottom of the page assuming my software works correctly. I cannot possibly keep up with all the cool music coming out, so hearing things from people directly helps filter that down considerably.

That's it for now, until next time!
