this orange one. I got the start pretty easy once I saw someone do it, the trick on the leap is to actually go closer to the wall since that's better, and then the top is just getting the right leg up into a knee bar & sitting on it. Fairly short all things considered, def on the easier side of V6es, but still, I did it!!

I've also done a few more V5s since my posts on Cohost, but after doing three there's less cause for celebration on each. There are two more V5s in this gym that are solidly in-reach for me, just need to stick the endings.

Also, there was this really cool blue V6 on this same wall from the set before the orange:

which was a great workout. I really liked the moves for it & almost completed it, but the end was always too scary after the exhausting middle. Fortunately, whoever sets this wall still tends to set climbs in my style, so I got one in the end anyways :)
