[Bandcamp Friday is coming up again](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays), so you know what that means!! More album reviews :)

## [Ninajirachi – I Love My Computer](https://ninajirachi.bandcamp.com/album/i-love-my-computer)

![Ninajirachi is surrounded by all sorts of computer equipment & wires in a chaotically-organized room](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0199a0a6-d94b-7447-b162-0e5be1cbfffc/i-love-my-computer.jpg>)

Man. I was extremely hyped for this one after listening to Girl EDM (covered in [issue #7](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2025-08-01-purchases-i-absolutely-must-make-this-bandcamp-friday-7-/)), and not only did this not disappoint, it completely blew me out of the water & is now my favorite thing put out by Ninajirachi.

This is a hyper-modern kind of EDM, very much the kind that can only be made on a computer, which this album is absolutely reverent of. It's also about Nina's relationship with computers & making music, most obviously in tracks like "F\*\*k My Computer" & "Sing Good", but really this theme is present in all tracks.

### Favorite track: 04 – CSIRAC

"All I Am", "All At Once", and "Sing Good" are all really good as well, but are sort of _too_ emotional for specific moods. CSIRAC is my overall favorite because it's a pumping bop no matter what!

## [Various Artists – Stream Palette 5 -Ranked-](https://diversesystem.bandcamp.com/album/stream-palette-5-ranked)

![Both the anime Stream Palette mascots sit in front of gaming battlestations](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0199a0a6-d94b-7447-b162-0e5be1cbfffc/stream-palette-5-ranked.jpg>)

Stumbled upon this by a chance algorithmic recommendation and yeah, I do love Japanese music, thanks for noticing! It's got all the big names like Zekk, Nhato, KO3, & more, with a corresponding diversity of genres like trance, phonk, color bass, & of course, dubstep:

### Favorite track: 08 – Nhato – Killer in the Mirror

<audio src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0199a0a6-d94b-7447-b162-0e5be1cbfffc/08_Killer_in_the_Mirror.mp3" controls></audio>

This being the 5th in a series does make me want to go back for more. The "-Ranked-" part seems to mean that this is the more hardcore version, as compared to "-Chatting-" which is more chill; wonder how that mix works on the previous, non-split albums? anyways

## [Iglooghost – Bronze Claw Iso](https://iglooghost.bandcamp.com/album/bronze-claw-iso-1)

![A construction worker stands in front of an excavator, its claw looming over his shoulder. They are in the middle of a desolate wasteland, everything color-graded a muddy brown](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0199a0a6-d94b-7447-b162-0e5be1cbfffc/bronze-claw-iso.jpg>)

With Iglooghost, you always know you're getting cool new experimental music, complete with tons of backing lore, this time at <https://neurowaste.net>. True to the theme, this one is a lot more industrial-sounding than past albums like Lei Line Eon or Tidal Memory Exo.

Because the sounds are so experimental, they're always a bit hit-or-miss for me, but there's usually a banger tucked away, like Slug Song. Not to insinuate the other tracks aren't good (of course they are), just that this one song gets stuck in my head quite often & doesn't leave.

### Favorite track: 04 – Slug Song

## [Moe Shop – EVO EVO](https://moeshop.bandcamp.com/album/evo-evo)

![An anime girl with piercing eyes, red hair, and tons of stickers on her including a "Moe Shop EVO EVO" one, is in front of an abstract blue background](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0199a0a6-d94b-7447-b162-0e5be1cbfffc/evo-evo.jpg> "title")

New classic Moe Shop! Their last full album release was [Moe Moe](https://moeshop.bandcamp.com/album/moe-moe), all the way back in March 2018!! They've certainly kept busy since then, with a steady stream of collabs with other artists, commercial commissions, & DJ sets over the years (as per their website, <https://www.moeshop.jp>). Still, it sure is nice to have something full-length to chew on :)

### Favorite track: 02 – COMPLICATIONS

Like I said, "new classic Moe Shop", very distinctive flavor of music they have :P Of course, this album also includes a bunch of collabs, including one with everyone's favorite Cohost artist:

### 07 – NEWLY HUMAN FEELING (feat. Jamie Paige)

<audio src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/0199a0a6-d94b-7447-b162-0e5be1cbfffc/07_NEWLY_HUMAN_FEELING.mp3" controls></audio>

Lastly, I do want to give another shoutout to an album that I've been listening to a bunch again, [Tanger – Prefer not to say](https://tangermusic.bandcamp.com/album/prefer-not-to-say). Can't believe it's almost been a full year... Anyways, that's it for this issue, happy spooky pumpkin season!
