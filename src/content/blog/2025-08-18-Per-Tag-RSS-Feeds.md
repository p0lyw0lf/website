Just a small site update! For anyone who was thinking "PolyWolf is so cool & awesome buuut she makes a lot of non-programming blog posts, i just want to see the [#programming](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/programming/) ones because those are super high-quality". Or if not exactly that thought then something similar, perhaps about another tag. In any case! ur in luck u hypothetical being from the future, i have that now :3

Put <https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/programming/rss.xml> (or any other tag) in your feed reader, or just point it at the <https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/programming/> page directly b/c I'm pretty sure the metadata is set up correctly there too. Adds a couple more seconds to my build time but eh totally worth it.

Also wow I cannot take even 1 hour for simple side-project without [running into another bug](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/11447#issuecomment-3198981545). I was doing a non-NixOS thing to get away from all the weird bugs!! Fortunately it is just "the URL being rendered in dev is `/tags/programming/rss.xml/`, which is different from the prod URL", not a hard blocker, but it does make my brain itch a little with the urge to fix it. No. I must resist... Too many other side-projects r crying out to be finished too...
