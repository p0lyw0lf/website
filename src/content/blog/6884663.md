## Please Read _[Blue Flag](https://www.viz.com/blue-flag)_.

it's tagline is "An unexpected love quadrangle with a dash of unrequited love." and hoo boy they were not kidding about the love quadrangle:

that's right! we have a whopping _3/4_ characters being some form of queer.

<details><summary>Diagram alt text & extra info:</summary>

- Taichi (dark haired guy, small):
  - -> Toma: childhood friends
  - -> Futaba: in love
  - -> Masumi: acquaintance. thinks she's mean to him
  - Toma -> Big Girl: thinks he has a crush
  - Futaba -> Toma: thinks she has a crush, so doesn't act on his own crush
- Toma (light haired guy, big & strong):
  - -> Taichi: in love (Gay!)
  - -> Futaba: good friend
  - -> Masumi: good friend, knows about her crush on Futaba
  - Taichi <-> Futaba: knows about their mutual attraction
- Futaba (light haired girl, small):
  - -> Taichi: "likes", but actually in love with
  - -> Toma: wants to be (in a Trans way!), but doesn't realize this and thinks it's love
    - I'm still using she/her pronouns for her since she's clearly an eggy trans, never outright confirmed, only hinted at quite a lot
  - -> Masumi: good friends
- Masumi (dark haired girl, aloof):
  - -> Taichi: acquaintance. thinks he needs to man up about his feelings more.
  - -> Toma: good friends, knows about his crush on Toma
  - -> Futaba: in love (Lesbian!)

Some notes about this diagram:

1. It contains spoilers, but also I believe they're the kind of spoilers that enhance the manga; the start is pretty slow and having this knowledge going in makes it better
2. These relations do shift a bit as time goes on, but this is sort of the baseline for how the drama works.
3. One could add more characters to this diagram, but this is the core of the quadrangle upon which most of the drama is built.

anyways yeah it's really really good & only 54 chapters (8 volumes), please give it a shot if u like coming-of-age manga that grapple with queerness.
