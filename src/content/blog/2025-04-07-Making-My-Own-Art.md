So it's kinda cool taking photos of art compiled by many other people, sort of as a maximalist thing ([see also previously](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2024-10-20-rit-pipe-graffiti-pictures/)):

![many flyers on a wall, some in chinese](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01960294-717e-7447-90cd-4cbc2fecf44b/IMG_9322.jpeg>)

but also, it's fun to make my own art sometimes:

![many many animal-themed memes drawn in yellow chalk on a blackboard. from left to right: Toriel holding a pie, "born to dilly-dally, forced to lock in" dog, "AWAKEN->PSYOP" cat wearing a wizard hat, "not on squeaking terms" rats, "it fucken WIMDY" fox, "laying in grass" wolf, "you might be running low on" red panda, S&P500 chart, E = mc^2 + AI, Crow Time crow, Dogdecahedron, Neco Arc, "low IQ meetup" orange cats, amogus, pleading fox, :(){:|:&};: cat, a kiwi bird eating a lemon and turning into a kiwi fruit, chick running between keyboard keys, a sleeping dog, a cat wearing food packaging, "damn" crow, Legoshi, gremlin cat, coat hanger cat, dog given a bath looking sad, "wawa" rainworld catslug, & a cat saying "JORP!"](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01960294-717e-7447-90cd-4cbc2fecf44b/IMG_9326.jpeg> "click to view full resolution")

both this & my [recent doodle](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2025-04-01-merry-april-fools/), despite being pretty bad objectively, make me feel happy & communicated similar feelings i think. i should do more art.
