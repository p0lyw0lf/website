if you've followed me for long enough, you'll know i'm not one for big statements around big events. however, this event is simply too big to ignore.

there will be grief today, there will be grief tomorrow, there will be grief when he formally assumes power, there will be grief WHEN (not if) he starts to come after you & the people you love. a tragedy beyond words that we'll live thru this history.

but we have to keep living. that's how we win. i'm currently fighting off another bout of covid, taking things one step at a time (again). i am constantly reminding myself, and hopefully you too: this is not how it ends. take care yoself, i love you
