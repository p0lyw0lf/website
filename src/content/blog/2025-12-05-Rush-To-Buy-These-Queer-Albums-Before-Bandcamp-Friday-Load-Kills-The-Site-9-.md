## [PSYQUI – Escape From The Future](https://psyqui.bandcamp.com/album/escape-from-the-future)

![PSYQUI walks into an old wooden door floating in the middle of an overgrown basketball field](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019aefa5-d076-7881-948a-c286050adaa0/cover.png>)

PSYQUI was my introduction into the fascinating world of Japanese EDM, by way of those pirate Youtube channels that just put a simple visualizer on top of some anime art. The albums he contributed to back when he was most most active in 2018-2019, like [SPD GAR 001](https://megarex-jp.bandcamp.com/album/spd-gar-001) and [TECHCORE EVANGELIX 01](https://megarex-jp.bandcamp.com/album/techcore-evangelix-01), absolutely still hold up to this day. His style is effect- & bass-heavy with a strong beat, one of those micro-genres where no one else can replicate it. It's been a long hiatus for sure, but I am very happy to see some more from him in a full EP!

### Favorite Track: 02 – Why Don't You

(this was the only non-queer album I promise the rest are Very Queer lol)

## [Poetically – Queer Oddities](https://poetically.bandcamp.com/album/queer-oddities)

![A clocky Trans woman with slightly disheveled hair & makeup gazes shirtlessly at the camera](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019aefa5-d076-7881-948a-c286050adaa0/cover.jpg>)

I found this artist somewhat randomly when their song Girls In High Heels came up in discovery a while ago. That's from their first album, [Odd Queer](https://poetically.bandcamp.com/album/odd-queer), and this is their B-sides follow up. Like the song that first enamored me, this album is very queer & a bit cheeky about it, distorted vocals & instruments leveraging the vocabulary of pop music to make something a little outside of it but still very catchy.

### Favorite Track: 06 – Sun of a Beach

## [passengerprincess – PASSENGERPRINCESS](https://4kcarpet.bandcamp.com/album/passengerprincess)

![The mascot, Passenger Puppy, has the album title written in highlights on their nose & green sparkles in their eyes to go with the purple theme](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019aefa5-d076-7881-948a-c286050adaa0/PASSENGERPRINCESS.jpg>)

Apparently this was a meme in some furry circles when it first came out?? I overlapped just enough to find out about it, and my rule of thumb "if it's a meme, it's probably good, because a lot of people liked it" hasn't let me down.

This debut album definitely falls into the "hyperpop" genre, with similarities to artists like 100 gecs & Vylet Pony being readily apparent. The messages are a little more plainly stated, but I still get the sense we are laughing with the artist; it's very joyful & laser-targeted at the queer + furry spheres I inhabit.

### Favorite Track: 04 – 4K CARPET

<audio src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019aefa5-d076-7881-948a-c286050adaa0/04_4K_CARPET.mp3" controls></audio>

## [June LaLonde – Framemaker](https://junelalonde.bandcamp.com/album/framemaker)

![An anthropomorphic animal walks away from a burned-out shadow in the grass, the chunk of land floating in the void](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/019aefa5-d076-7881-948a-c286050adaa0/Framemaker.jpg> "title")

Before listening to this album, I did not understand what the big deal w/ guitar was, "why are people so obsessed with that instrument?". After listening to this album, now I understand. June LaLonde uses it to _incredible_ effect, pulling emotions out of me I was not ready to feel yet ones I am glad to have felt anyways. It was written while she was grieving the deaths of people close to her, which checks out. The resulting pieces are sad, yes, but also hopeful, a fitting message for such a commemoration. My favorite song is one of the more up-beat ones, but I think this album deserves to be listened to in full. Give it a shot even if you too think it's out of your strike zone; it sure did hit for me at least.

### Favorite Track: 06 – Land of Kings

I've had a blast listening to lots of albums this year! it's been a great way to consume music and I plan to keep this going into next year too. Hopefully there will continue to be Bandcamp Fridays to force my hand at periodic roundups like this, otherwise I tend not to remember lol. Anyways that is it for now, happy listening!!
