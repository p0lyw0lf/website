"But PolyWolf!" I hear you say, "That's not a blog post, that's just someone's ([Izzy Muerte](https://izzys.casa/)'s) OSS project's landing page!"

And yes, you're somewhat correct. But contained in the [guides](https://ixm.one/guides/installation) section is one of the, if not _**the**_ most comprehensive series of posts on modern CMake that exist today. If you've worked with CMake recently, I highly recommend you check this out.
