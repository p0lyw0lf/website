Besides the ones I already linked in the rest of my [#music](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/music/) tag posts, obviously. Going through followed artists actually uncovered a lot of great stuff I would have otherwise missed had I only stuck with regular listening habits, neat! As a reminder, Bandcamp Friday is a 24hr period where Bandcamp takes no cut, passing all funds it gets directly to artists, so it's the best time to buy all the stuff we've been saving up!

## [Ninajirachi – girl EDM (disc 1)](https://ninajirachi.bandcamp.com/album/girl-edm-disc-1)

![Split-screen, a smeared, ghostly angelic figure with anime features materializes](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01986326-c3ea-7119-8ff0-ebe7b38e38d0/girl-edm-1.jpg>)

Very fun & energetic EDM. Album description on Bandcamp:

> there are girls and EDM and there is girl EDM... cat ears, furry paws, headphones on world off, sci-fi fantasy cosplay windows down hands in the air, kandi bracelet, computer, the next step in evolution and a window to the soul <3

i think that about sums it up ya!

Favorite track: 03 – Ninacamina <audio src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01986326-c3ea-7119-8ff0-ebe7b38e38d0/03_Ninacamina.mp3" controls></audio>

I'd also like to purchase her next album, [I Love My Computer](https://ninajirachi.bandcamp.com/album/i-love-my-computer), but that is only a pre-order so i am unsure if the full discount applies. oh well doing it anyways.

## [Bad Computer feat. Gold – Connected](https://monstercatmedia.bandcamp.com/track/connected)

![Vaporwave-style 3D render with flowing gold statues, a cherry blossom branch, a checkerboard ceiling, and a Windows 95 "error connecting to internet" dialog, among other things](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01986326-c3ea-7119-8ff0-ebe7b38e38d0/connected.jpg>)

Not an album, just a single. Also getting [Move Like This](https://ncsmusic.bandcamp.com/track/move-like-this), basically everything Bad Computer puts out immediately goes on my favorites playlist.

Pretty much their own microgenre of EDM at this point, very distinctive style, just part of that classic Monstercat sound ya know? u could load a Rocket League menu to this

## [Emplexx & Sunnexo – Control Shift](https://sunnexo.bandcamp.com/album/control-shift)

![Emi and Sunnexo strike a pose on their respective halves of the album cover. Emi is a normal girl on a blue background with various colored patches, and Sunnexo is a robot girl on a black computer-esque background. There's an overall pixelated aesthetic](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01986326-c3ea-7119-8ff0-ebe7b38e38d0/control-shift.jpg>)

It is Emplexx & Sunnexo, two indie artists who I already really enjoy separately, doing a collab!! Must-buy single for sure yaya

They call this genre "complextro 2" and who am i to argue with the masters?

They also wrote about the making-of process on their blog, including the visuals! Very cool behind-the-scenes stuff, u should check it out: <https://sunnexo.moe/controlshift>

## [Various Artists – emo.gen 3](https://lostfrog.bandcamp.com/album/emo-gen-3)

![Futuristic forlorn-looking anime girl clad in regal white dress against a dark background, with retro microphones suspended on thin strands from out of frame](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01986326-c3ea-7119-8ff0-ebe7b38e38d0/emo-gen-3.jpg>)

Doctór! inject that breakcore directly into my veins, please :3

Apparently this may be the final "emotional breakcore" compilation? As much as I enjoy having Literal Hours Of Breakcore to jam to & crave more, I can understand it is a massive effort to put together, plus there are two more like this lol.

technically u don't have to pay for this one but i did anyways just to be polite. haven't listened to the whole thing yet, just choosing the track by which i discovered it:

38 – Yem – Twin Hearts <audio src="https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01986326-c3ea-7119-8ff0-ebe7b38e38d0/38_Twin_Hearts.mp3" controls></audio>

UPDATE 2025-08-10: I have listened to the whole thing now. 11, 12, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, & 36 r all Pretty Good but i still think 38 is the most interesting. got it in one huh !

## [Jamie Paige – Constant Companions (Deluxe Edition)](https://jamiepaige.bandcamp.com/album/constant-companions-deluxe-edition)

![A human hand holding a black cat paw hand, surrounded by fun doodles crawling over both](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01986326-c3ea-7119-8ff0-ebe7b38e38d0/constant-companions-deluxe-edition.jpg>)

yes i know i posted about the normal version before. but this one has [BIRDBRAIN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iVlSNpq8i8) on it. and [ROT FOR CLOUT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AjJZEcMdww) again. i would buy another album for those two songs again :P

No need to post track snippets for this one, just watch those youtube videos if you haven't already. soon u too will be up birding ur brain & rotting ur clout :)))

Anyways, there are many, _many_ more tracks I'm buying (including some for a project I don't want to spoil!!), these are just the ones I thought were worth sharing today. Now go! Go forth and consume!!
