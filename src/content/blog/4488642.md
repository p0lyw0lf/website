I am writing in it following along with <https://nix.dev/tutorials/module-system/module-system> and without the safety net of statically analyzed types there is just this vague sense of unease that my code will be wrong and I won't know.

don't get me wrong it is very cool that they wrote an entire metaprogramming and typechecking system within Nix itself, to make sure module inputs/outputs are correct, but uh, it seems like that was pretty clearly in spite of the language, not because of it. and now there's so much magic going on behind the scenes that i have to read this 3-hour long tutorial just to understand the surface layer.

anyways. I am still glad such a tutorial exists because without it I would be even more lost. docs like this r good. this offsets all the possible badness from the language being dynamically-typed, clearly
