Great movie. I do not have any previous exposure to Tim Robinson or Paul Rudd comedy so this all felt very fresh, but even so other ppl agree it's well-paced, immaculately shot, and just plain has something interesting to say despite being a comedy.

Main character is a dipshit & very cringe, but never unwatchably so, at least for me. He's a narcissist beyond all redemption, a child's impulse control in a man's body, a toxic human being rewarded by the toxic society he inhabits, and many other poignant descriptions _explicitly_ pointed to by the film. And that's just one of the characters. Anyways I think it's  a pretty good flick you should watch it.
