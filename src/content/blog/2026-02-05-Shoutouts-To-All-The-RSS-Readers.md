From the bottom of my heart, thank you for reading. It means a lot to me that y'all actively choose to read my stuff. I see you, I appreciate you, this diversity is what keeps the web alive.

[^elfeed]: There are a whole two of you!! Congratulations on being first this is epic actually
[^feedparser]: Presumably this is someone's personal tool and not just scraping giving the frequency but no way to be sure ig... Same goes for the few other libraries on this list.
[^freshrss]: This is the most popular one I see, makes sense it's the one I use too :3
[^miniflux]: After FreshRSS, this is the second-most-popular reader I see.
[^netnewswire]: My app of choice in conjunction with my FreshRSS server, can also work standalone tho!
[^sharnoff]: Someone built their own from completely from scratch I love it,,,
[^spacecowboys]: I see more than one of this too. The android app is just called "Feeder", I like the author's name a lot better.
[^tt-rss]: This version is _definitely_ unsupported, though the project has been kept alive [under a new tt-rss GitHub Org](https://github.com/tt-rss/tt-rss) after the original maintainer left.
