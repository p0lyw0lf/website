Originally published on Cohost. Initially, I had planned on writing [pwcc](/tags/pwcc/) in Lean 4, and this post was part of that exploratory process.

Following along with <https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/examples/bintree.lean.html>, because i Just Want To Start Writing Code and reading examples is the best way to get acquainted.

Starting off, we have just a simple polymorphic tree definition:

```lean4
inductive Tree (β : Type v) where
  | leaf
  | node (left : Tree β) (key : Nat) (value : β) (right : Tree β)
  deriving Repr
```

And, skipping over a few things, both a naïve `toList` implementation and a tail-recursive one:

```lean4
def Tree.toList (t : Tree β) : List (Nat × β) :=
  match t with
  | leaf => []
  | node l k v r => l.toList ++ [(k, v)] ++ r.toList

def Tree.toListTR (t : Tree β) : List (Nat × β) :=
  go t []
where
  go (t : Tree β) (acc : List (Nat × β)) : List (Nat × β) :=
    match t with
    | leaf => acc
    | node l k v r => go l ((k, v) :: go r acc)
```

Neat! Good to see that a functional programming language can in fact do functional programming things. Wait, what's this next paragraph:

<blockquote>
We now prove that <code>t.toList</code> and <code>t.toListTR</code> return the same list. The proof is on induction, and as we used the auxiliary function <code>go</code> to define <code>Tree.toListTR</code>, we use the auxiliary theorem <code>go</code> to prove the theorem.
</blockquote>

oh...

```lean4
theorem Tree.toList_eq_toListTR (t : Tree β)
        : t.toList = t.toListTR := by
  simp [toListTR, go t []]
where
  go (t : Tree β) (acc : List (Nat × β))
     : toListTR.go t acc = t.toList ++ acc := by
    induction t generalizing acc <;>
      simp [toListTR.go, toList, *, List.append_assoc]
```

<blockquote>
The <code>[csimp]</code> annotation instructs the Lean code generator to replace any <code>Tree.toList</code> with <code>Tree.toListTR</code> when generating code.
</blockquote>

oh???

```lean4
@[csimp] theorem Tree.toList_eq_toListTR_csimp
                 : @Tree.toList = @Tree.toListTR := by
  funext β t
  apply toList_eq_toListTR
```

Like i knew that this was the "functional programming used for proving things" language, but such a tight integration w/ the compiler itself is very cool. Formal verification ftw!
