little bit late to the party on this one whoops :P good fiction is timeless, anything by Blackle Mori is an absolute banger, "absolute banger" > "good", âˆ´ i can review this whenever i want Q.E.D.

it's a noir-style short story, "homage" is maybe the wrong word, so "snapshot" perhaps, of a certain contemporary internet culture that i myself sometimes rub up against as a stereotypical Internet Transgender. I'd be interested to know how someone not as versed in the culture interprets it; would they develop a better understanding? would they miss a whole bunch of references that are essential to understanding? are the parts that i think are essential not actually? only one way to find out

masterfully executed prose & structure. i really appreciate the attention to detail on all the computery bits too, really soothes my soul. [itch.io](https://blackle.itch.io/bteq) VN background pictures & text timing add a whole 'nother layer on ambiance to the experience that i really enjoyed. ty Blake Mori for the excellent story <3
