my dog is the cutest ever and these photos do a terrible job of explaining her cuteness so i'll do so between each picture <3

whenever i come home (to my parents' house), she greets me with a lot of trills & tail wagging

![there is a hand petting the dog](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9193.jpeg>)

she's always carrying a toy in her mouth, different favorite every day, there's an entire box of toys to choose from and she does purposefully switch out sometimes

![petting intensifies, causing blurry shapes](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9194.jpeg>)

our backyard is fenced-in, but she often finds a way to slip thru when we let her out at night to go pee to chase foxes. of course, it's only at night when we can't see her escape method

she always comes back eventually, though sometimes not before the neighbors find her & make a post on the neighborhood facebook group

![petting with a foot](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9197.jpeg>)

out of my family, i am by far her favorite. one theory is that i was the first to hold her when we picked her up, but another is that i don't mind playing physical with her

![back to hand petting](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9199.jpeg>)

she loves to wrestle, lick your face, jump up on your chair to see what's causing the tasty smell on the table

![looking around while being pet](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9200.jpeg>)

she knows what the limits are, tho; she never bites or barks w/o good reason, and does not take food unless explicitly offered

![curling back into the legs](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9201.jpeg>)

the house is dog-proofed, including the living room sofa she loves to jump up and snuggle on

![pet the scruff](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9202.jpeg>)

her fur is so soft and i could just pet her forever. she loves being pet forever too, so this deal works out

![looking around again](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9203.jpeg>)

honestly it's most forms of attention lol. she just loves to play and be loved

![standing by the door, looking wistfully](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01957892-761a-7bb6-b29e-775845a17176/IMG_9204.jpeg>)

she follows me around the house everywhere, and will start/end the day outside by bedroom, if not kenneled up

im gonna miss her when i leave :(
