Recently, I found out about the [Coho Photo Zine](https://coho.photo/), a zine run by former members of the Cohost photography community whom I really look up to. By "recently" I mean "Tuesday", and their deadline was today (Friday), so I had about 3 days to sort thru my backlog and edit something matching the theme. And I did!! Having some creative pressure was actually very helpful, as was seeing so many inspiring photos by all the other participants.

The zine is not coming out for a while, and there's no guarantee any of these photos will be in it, so I figured I'd just post them now :3

The theme for the inaugural zine issue is "yes-and-ism". As per one of the organizers:

> it comes from someone asking "is that__?" and the response being "yes, and [long explanation]". it was a unique aspect to cohost style photography that most of us haven't found a place for outside of cohost or the various life raft servers, where the focus was less on the actual image but more on the process of image making and the conversations said processes inspired.

There's more themes from the [primer](https://coho.photo/primer) that I tried to incorporate too, like orthorealism + deliberate imperfection, with my overall thrust being "what would look cool after being passed thru a `-quality 1` encoder?" The end results are better than anything I could have asked for.
