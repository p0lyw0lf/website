wow turns out i am a sucker for unconventional artsy stories dealing with the human psyche. I did love [Shimeji Simulation](/blog/5931968/), after all.

this one is a lot heavier though. unashamed to portray adults as fundamentally broken creatures, and children as just one step away from being broken by adulthood or already broken by a traumatic upbringing[^1]. let alone any of the sex/violence stuff.

anyways! i plan on continuing with it. likely won't end up as a favorite because it makes me feel sad & confused instead of happy, but likely worth it nonetheless

[^1]: that was really sad to type out wow

what a ride. glad there was something approximating a happy ending, at least. I started reading it quite some time ago and have been slowly digesting all 7 volumes (13 parts?) as I could stomach. There were parts I didn't get because I don't have enough life experience and parts that made me hate everyone in it and parts that I'm grateful I'll never understand, but that's just life I guess. Big and messy and impossible to summarize without having lived thru it. I recommend this manga if you can stand being reminded of the human condition.

the art's pretty nice too ya
