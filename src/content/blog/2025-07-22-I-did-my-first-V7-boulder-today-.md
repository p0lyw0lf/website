did not think it would come so soon lol. been doing V5s somewhat consistently so i thought "ah, surely my third[^1] V6 will come soon" but no, jumped a grade instead lol

![Red V7 with a double start in the corner between two volumes. Both start holds are like platforms. The next hold is a narrow pincher with a wide platform (so, easy to grab) connected to a volume sticking far out from the wall on the right (so you have to jump to it), then two more slightly smaller of the same that are on the wall to the left of the volume. There's a pretty good crimp on the far side of the upper volume, and the top finishes with an upside-down hold directly above the hold you jump to.](<https://static.wolfgirl.dev/polywolf/blog/01983264-d0fb-7332-85e9-2ed400f9cedb/IMG_0098.jpeg> "dyno time :3")

It's a fun one!

<details><summary>Here's my beta:</summary>

1. Facing away from the wall, just put hands on both starting holds to lift yourself off the ground. Start complete!
2. Left foot on lower hold first, then work your right foot onto the upper hold, making sure to get your toe on it instead of your heel. Most people struggle w/ this (it is a bit of a flexibility check)
3. Jump to the hold :) Curl your body after making contact with the hold so your feet land just below the volume, stabilization is key.
4. Left hand goes up, bumps to next. Feet are still smearing to help with this.
5. Heel-hook the hold your right hand is on, and match your right hand to your left. Some ppl do toe but I find heel is a lot easier here.
6. Now that your hands are solid, switch your right foot to the toe, and reach with your right to the crimp.
7. Use that pull to get your weight way over your right leg, switching your left hand from a pinch to a post.
8. Use that post to help get your left leg onto the hold with your right leg.
9. As you're standing up, reach with your left for the finish hold, then match with your right.

I do think this one counts as a real V7. It is a strength + flexibility test V7, but I can pass that test, so yeah let's go!!! feels good to [keep a resolution](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2025-01-05-new-year-s-resolutions/) :)

[^1]: Technically, I've also done this yellow V6 that's in the gym currently, but I don't count it because most everyone agrees it is Too Easy, tho it's also very fun to do. I'd grade it a V4 tops. Similarly, there are other V5s in the gym that I've flashed that I'd personally grade like V4 or even V3. Maybe the setters are soft, or maybe I've been getting a lot better at certain styles? idk
