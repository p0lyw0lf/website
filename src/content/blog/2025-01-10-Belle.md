Pretty good. Visually stunning, and the music was excellent too. Don't think too hard about the plot or worldbuilding tho. Or even the overall themes besides "art is so pretty :)"

It at its best when it shows you a spectacle and lets you infer what the characters from body language/presentation alone, and does an excellent job of this many times.

But it's crazy to me that, after having such a good example (Suzu staring down the dad "protecting" the kids (watching him scamper away was cathartic)), they immediately have an "I love you very much", "Thanks you helped me get over my fear" dialogue. Like COME ON

It's Ghibli. You should watch it anyways no matter what I say.
