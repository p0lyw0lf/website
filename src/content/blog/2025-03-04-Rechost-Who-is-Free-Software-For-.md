Interesting read from [@tante](https://tldr.nettime.org/@tante). "For hackers by hackers" is pretty much exactly what I imagined when making [Write Your Own Tools]https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2024-09-28-write-your-own-tools/), but he's exactly correct in that not everyone can or should do this.

Going to need to puzzle on this a bit more.
