I dug into this because it had been on my mind for a while, and I wanted to get something working before I uploaded Japan trip photos. A couple nights later, I have learned a bit about how Astro & Remark/Rehype & Vite work, and a lot about how what I'm trying to do is futile.

From my understanding, this is how Astro optimizes [local images in Markdown files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-markdown-files):
1. [remark-collect-images.ts](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8d4e566f5420c8a5406e1e40e8bae1c1f87cbe37/packages/markdown/remark/src/remark-collect-images.ts), a Markdown AST transformation step, finds all the image paths that look like `![]()` and not `<img src="" />`, so we only optimize the Markdown images. It records this information into context that's passed to the next step.
2. [rehype-images.ts](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8d4e566f5420c8a5406e1e40e8bae1c1f87cbe37/packages/markdown/remark/src/rehype-images.ts), an HTML AST transform step, turns all those images that look like `<img src="./local.png" />`[^1] and turns them into something that looks like `<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_="{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./local.png&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}" />`. It does this because it's easier to look for, and safer to parse later compared to raw HTML.
3. [vite-plugin-markdown/images.ts](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8d4e566f5420c8a5406e1e40e8bae1c1f87cbe37/packages/astro/src/vite-plugin-markdown/images.ts) takes the list of local image URLs (generated as part of transforming the Markdown into HTML in the above steps), and the HTML with these `__ASTRO_IMAGE_` things in them, and generates a full-on Astro component, Javascript source & everything, to be rendered later.

Phew, that's a lot!! Hope you're still following along :)

So, the procedure I described works perfectly fine for standalone `.md` pages. The problem comes when trying to apply this same transformation to markdown files rendered as part of a [content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-content/), which is what my blog files are stored as. Instead of being rendered as part of the "main" Astro flow, content collection entries are rendered separately, as part of a loader, like [content/loaders/glob.ts](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8d4e566f5420c8a5406e1e40e8bae1c1f87cbe37/packages/astro/src/content/loaders/glob.ts#L183). For Markdown, this calls into [vite-plugin-markdown/content-entry-type.ts](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8d4e566f5420c8a5406e1e40e8bae1c1f87cbe37/packages/astro/src/vite-plugin-markdown/content-entry-type.ts), which does no such image replacement.

And I don't think it can! The whole reason this code does the `__ASTRO_IMAGE_` rigamarole is so it can call the image transformation function at the correct time. With content collections, all the rendering happens "too early", so the images can't be transformed.

Alternatively, I _could_ use [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), which is like Markdown but compiles to Javascript instead of HTML, which _does_ always have the image transformation step, thanks to [rehype-image-to-component.ts](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8d4e566f5420c8a5406e1e40e8bae1c1f87cbe37/packages/integrations/mdx/src/rehype-images-to-component.ts). However, I do not like MDX's weird character restrictions (c'mon, no `<`, really??), so I will not use it >:(

At this point, I'm seriously considering moving away from Astro's built-in image optimization service to my own... For now though, I'm giving up ðŸ˜”

[^1]: I believe this is a minor bug: if you have both `![](./local.png)` _and_ `<img src="./local.png" />`, I think the latter image will be transformed when it shouldn't be. At least, that's if I'm reading the code right, which I may well not be :P
