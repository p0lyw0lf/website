I have been having a jolly old time subscribing to people's blogs, new & old, w/ RSS. I can't believe I missed out on this for so long, it's really nice to get updates directly from the source w/o having to wade thru social media first. Having a dedicated "place" for reading long-form helps too.

My setup is a FreshRSS server (self-hosted) that I read with NetNewsWire (iOS). This works spectacularly and I imagine I'll be doing this for years to come.

A particularly cool thing about FreshRSS is the ability to share feeds. In lieu of support for that built into this blog (we all know <https://wolfgirl.dev/cybersec/> is a half-measure), I think this is the next best thing.

A "dynamic OPML" of all the blogs I follow can be found [here](https://freshrss.wolfgirl.dev/api/query.php?user=polywolf&t=1QZGHzuQLRcRdthNi7H22B&f=opml). How it works is, your RSS client will subscribe to my list, and then for each site on the list, subscribe to it. In case that doesn't work, you can subscribe to just the amalgamation of RSS [here](https://freshrss.wolfgirl.dev/api/query.php?user=polywolf&t=1QZGHzuQLRcRdthNi7H22B&f=rss), but I think that's a poorer experience since every time I add a new site it'll clog up the most recently added posts.

In case you don't feel like drinking from the firehose, I also have a feed that's just the articles I extremely super extra enjoy, [here](https://freshrss.wolfgirl.dev/api/query.php?user=polywolf&t=264eQGcy4W52VYwdw9DfsD&f=rss). Unfortunately, NetNewsWire doesn't have support for labels, so I can't really be any less selective about what I re-share, sorry!
