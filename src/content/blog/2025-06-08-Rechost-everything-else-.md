If you want to watch it on desktop or TV, or if you don't want to have to rotate your device, watch the [static version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qITGvxw5Vhk) instead.

this music video/multimedia artwork project had a bit of an impact on me (forced a few tears out). very very good song and a very very good retrospective post on the personal journey of making the song.

The post cites "Melodic, emotional drum & bass", as the target, and Ash really knocked it out of the park on this one. Later on they mention Porter Robinson & Virtual Riot as inspirations when it came to the vocal processing, and I can definitely hear that reflected in the beats too. I think "EVERYTHING!" even holds up against those titans? in my ears, at least. Like I said, very very good stuff :3

hard to exactly put into words the emotions i got out of it but i will try anyways: it's about youth, it's about queer joy, it's about that time of night when you're hanging out with your friends & you completely forget yourself & all your worries, or that time where re-unite with friends after a couple of years & everything just clicks back into place, it's about in-jokes & cat pictures & late-night discord calls. it's about Ash, but it's also about you & me. that's all i got, peace
