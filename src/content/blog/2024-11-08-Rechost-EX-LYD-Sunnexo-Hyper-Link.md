<https://sunnexo.moe/hyperlink>

you may recall from [a previous blog post](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2024-10-04-bandcamp-friday-haul/) that I am a fan of Sunnexo, and also a fan of their devlogs where they describe what goes into their piece! It's a good song, very cool to get a glimpse into how it was produced, b/c i don't know a whole lot about that sorta stuff lol

(also while on the topic of music i should mention, i listened to Tanger's latest album, [Prefer not to say](https://tangermusic.bandcamp.com/album/prefer-not-to-say), and it's _**really frickin good**_ so yeah give that a listen too)
