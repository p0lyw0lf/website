At long last, I finally set aside some time to go thru my Cohost data export & salvage some posts for this blog! Got a few "ouuugh" moments as I was browsing thru it again (list of all people who wished me happy birthday, by proxy of me using user notes for that exclusively). Also, belated apologies to the RSS users who saw all 27 posts appear at once :P

I _would've_ used the [#cohost](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/cohost/) tag to collect all the posts, but uh, there are quite a lot, so I've opted to not do that. Instead, my organization scheme is roughly as follows:
* All programming things go in [#programming](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/programming/) (obviously)
* All media reviews go in [#reviews](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/reviews/)
* All writing goes in [#writing](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/writing/)
* All personal updates go in [#wolfgirlagenda](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/wolfgirlagenda/)
* A smattering of all of the above goes in [#cohost](https://wolfgirl.dev/tags/cohost/) if I think it's particularly emblematic of my time on the site, or if it's related to the site after its demise (2024-10-01, NEVER FORGET)

There's also this post, which I'll use to collect my absolute favorite chosts:

## 5: [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/7283112/)

A spontaneous game I played where I built a scene out of very concise audience provided responses. I got kinda burned out of it tho, which shows, but I still think there's some cool stuff in there.

## 4: [Software Packaging Is A Nightmare](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2613009/)

Fairly popular at the time, and I did spend a lot of time on it, but I am not so sure how it holds up. Judge for yourself!

## 3: [The One Where I Rationalize Why I'm Not Trans](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/679878/) and [The One Where I Come Out As Trans](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/759538/)

Ah, good 'ol transitory life periods, where I have lots of time to reflect on who I am and who I want to be, and enough exposure to trans people to be able to realize some things finally.

I've realized even more since writing these pieces. Nice to look back on them as time-capsules of what I was thinking in that moment in time.

## 2: [Exploring Mutexes in C](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2064554/) and [Learning Memory Order in C with Mutexes](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2091838/)

The mutex posts!! I am probably inordinately proud of these, but I do think they are and will continue to be useful introductory pieces for this subject matter.

## 1: [PolyWolf's Style Guide](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/6372078/)

In which I lay out some grammatical, punctuational, & other rules to follow when drafting my blog posts. Perhaps a bit unorthodox as my top choice, especially since it wasn't nearly as well-received at the time as all the other pieces on this list, but I think it holds up very well as a piece of humor, plus I... actually follow these rules now?? It's the most formative of all, in that sense.
