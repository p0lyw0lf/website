i read the first 4 volumes in a day, then had to pace myself with the last couple because i didn't want to waste a drop of goodness.

it has the best possible ending. everything was leading up to that moment. i'm so glad i was alive to experience it ;-;

in the running for best manga i've ever read, 10/10 no notes (that i can give without spoilers)
