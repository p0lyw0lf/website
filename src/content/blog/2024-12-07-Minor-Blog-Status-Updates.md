I've updated the CSS in my post composer to be a bit more like the CSS in my actual blog; we have better link, code, & blockquote styles, to be specific. It's not exact since I don't really want to pull in an entire syntax highlighting library & I'm too lazy to actually put everything in a monorepo where it can share CSS (tho, those are both things I might want to do eventually.

I've also updated my crossposter to post tags on Mastodon and Bluesky whenever I post something here. However, uh, i haven't added any tags to this post, so I won't know if it works until I write a future post, whoops (:

Last thing: apparently, my [\`Functor\` in Rust](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2024-11-24-a-novel-idea-about-functor-in-rust/) post made it onto HackerNews?? I think the full path was bsky -> lobste.rs -> HN, which checks out. And as it turns out, getting onto HN is pretty good for SEO: my click rate saw a tenfold increase[^1]. However, I made the classic mistake of looking at the HN comments, I really should not have done that...

In any case! I don't plan on "optimizing" my content for _anything_. I am very proud of that blog post, not because of some external validation[^2], but because I am pleased with my writing quality for it. I will continue to post the things that I want, and right now, I felt like giving a small update. good night :)

[^1]: Which is to say, my clicks per month jumped from 2 to 20 :P
[^2]: From orange site/other randos, more so. I do really appreciate external validation from friends, from "liking the crossposted announcement post" to "writing me an email", lets me know people care
