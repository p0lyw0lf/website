Wow, I haven't blogged since last year! :P

Bit late on this one; Visited family for Christmas, friends of New Years, and going on a work trip tomorrow, so I've been keeping busy. Still feel like I should keep up this tradition, because they are good milestones and a time for me to remember Cohost (R.I.P. eggbug you will live on in our hearts). Below are some explanations of why I chose these goals for 2025:

## Bouldering

Quite recently, I did [my first V6 boulder](https://wolfgirl.dev/blog/2024-11-02-i-did-my-first-v6-boulder-today-/), and have felt pretty confident tackling other hard V5s and easy V6s, so I think a V7 next year is very doable. I climb with friends every week as my main form of irl socialization, so this resolution is less "make a new routine" and more "stick to a current routine and maybe improve on it". Not too much else to say about this one, I just love climbing!

## Clothing

Over the last year, as I've become more comfortable with myself being trans (finally out to core family!!), I've become painfully aware of how boymode-ed my closet is. I do not have a single dress, or skirt, or stocking, or pair of leggings, or even just a cool jacket. In total, I have:

- yoga pants (purchased during the exciting first months of transition)
- sports bras (purchased later when breasts started to come in)
-
- that's it that's the entire list

Now don't get me wrong, I rock the t-shirt+jeans & athleisure fits quite well. But to have _nothing_ feels a bit wrong. I want something better to wear, if not out in the world at large, then at least to the cool transgender parties. Target is 1-3 items.

## Running

I got COVID three times last year. That sucked big-time, because for 1/4 of the year I was doing nothing except bedrotting. It sucks even more because, after each round, I've been left with an increasingly worse lingering symptom: headaches. Fortunately, it's not a constant pain like it was more acutely to the infection, but basically any other headache I would otherwise get (stress, dehydration, etc.) is multiplied by 3. I am taken out if I don't carefully manage those.

However, after this last round, there's been an even worse outcome: I can't run anymore without getting a headache. Short jogs are fine, but as soon as I break 2 miles it gets pretty bad. Potentially a side-effect of a dehydration headache, and my slowness is potentially a result of not doing it for so long (and not because of anything more wrong, here's hoping!). Earlier, when I couldn't even go for walks without this happening, I was very very scared for my future. I count myself lucky that these symptoms are getting better over time at all.

So! This goal is actually 2 distinct goals hidden in a trench-coat: resolve the COVID symptoms preventing me from running, and then actually start running enough again to do a half-marathon. This is my most ambitious goal of the year, because I do not entirely control the first part of the process, but it's also my most desired one.
