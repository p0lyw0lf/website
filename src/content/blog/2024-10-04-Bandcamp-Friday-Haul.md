Usually, my music workflow goes like this:

1. Discover new music on ~~Spotify~~ Deezer, sometimes YouTube
2. Keep a "canonical" list of songs I like in a YouTube playlist, transferring over my Deezer likes every once in a while
3. Once that list grows to about 100-150 songs, prune it.
4. If the list remains large, purchase all the songs (Bandcamp > iTunes > not paying)

However, the sporadic nature of this process means the purchasing time rarely overlaps with a Bandcamp Friday. Since nowadays, Bandcamp Fridays are so rare, I figured I'd get in on this one while I still can.

I won't be covering _all_ the albums I purchased (there are a bit too many to list, you can see them on my [bandcamp page](https://bandcamp.com/p0lyw0lf) if u really want), and will instead be highlighting a few I think deserve special mention.

> NOTE: due to time pressures, I have not listened to all albums in full, these are just my first impressions

## [Emplexx - Hiraeth](https://emplexx.bandcamp.com/album/hiraeth)

Really happy to see this one come out! I've been following their work for a while, they've gone thru some rough patches, so it's nice to see an album representing work they feel proud of. And boy should they; this is, in my opinion, genre-defining work in complextro. "LUV U" is one of my favorite songs ever, and the rest seem of equal quality. Good album.

## [Sunnexo & Tanger - Any% EP](https://sunnexo.bandcamp.com/album/any-ep)

I really like Sunnexo's style. Very chiptune-y, bit dubstep-y, nice video-game-inspired music that is very catchy. They have a [devlog](https://sunnexo.moe/any)! Good EP.

## [camoufly - In Plain Sight](https://camouflybeats.bandcamp.com/album/in-plain-sight)

Bit more laid-back than the other albums, but still great energy in these. Dance-able beats, neat instrumentation, all the drops are so groovy. idk how to describe it, it's just a good EP.

## [Andrew Huang & Undulae - Labyrinth](https://andrewhuang.bandcamp.com/album/labyrinth)

I don't do experimental music too much, but this album might just convince me! I liked these songs a lot more than I would think at first glance. Andrew Huang works his magic once again, good album.
