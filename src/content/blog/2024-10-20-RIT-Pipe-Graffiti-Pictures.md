I took these pictures while visiting a friend at RIT. They showed me around a bunch of places, and I think these pipes are the absolute coolest.

Also, I added a file upload feature to my post composer! This was partly because I was too lazy to connect my phone to my computer to upload these images, but also because that laziness is a good excuse to put in more effort now so i can be even lazier later :P Now I just gotta work on the post previewer so I can actually see them before I post...

There's a whole rigamarole with IAM permissions for S3 (create policy -> attach policy to group -> add user to group -> create access keys for user) and Nginx not liking file uploads by default (`client_max_body_size`) but honestly that's par for course. Anyways, you're here for images, so here's images:

<style>
img {
  width: 100%;
  margin-bottom: 4rem;
}
</style>
