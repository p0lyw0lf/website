For those unaware of what that means: it is bowling slang for "three strikes in a row". Pretty slick!

I got it on the 10th frame of my first game, my touch was dialed in to hit them all back-to-back like that. However, I couldn't replicate another strike for the rest of the night. Had some fun impossible-looking curve shots for spares tho.

Bowling is fun while I am fresh but as the night wears on and I become tired (mentally & physically) it becomes more enjoyable to cheer others on than to maximize my own points.

Good stuff tho. Don't plan on doing it more often tho (:
