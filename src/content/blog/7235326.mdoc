Also very good. Art is at a much higher level, soundtrack and colors maintain the original unique vibe. Took me ~1hr to get thru my first playthru, there are apparently 5 total endings possible (judging by Steam achievements). Still very well worth the pricetag.

Playing [the first game](/blog/7195563/) is essential to understand this one imo. The opening cutscene and the ending I got simply don't make sense without it. Do it go play them now don't procrastinate like i did
