Breakpoints! Light/Dark mode!! Actually readable long-form text!!! You can really see the Cohost inspiration. Still tried to keep it somewhat my own style, with no `border-radius` & my own colorscheme (not that I'm very good at designing colorschemes, lol). Much happier with it now :3

Speaking of Cohost, today's the day I finally start to work thru my following list to make sure I'm keeping up with ppl as they move on to various places. I did a pretty OK job right after the closure announcement, but still need to confirm. Just to get a sense of closure. I'll wait until I receive the full data dump to actually start moving posts over.

Short post, not a lot to say today, see y'all next time!
