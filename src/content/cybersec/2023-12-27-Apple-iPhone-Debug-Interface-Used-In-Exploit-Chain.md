the exploit chain itself is crazy (lol at the "get full physical memory access just to launch Safari" step) and this dives into a specific part that's really interesting: Apple seems to have left in a debug interface in their GPU and the attackers used DMA in that to bypass some authentication.

the interesting part is that, by the author's estimation, this interface is not publicly documented, so would either have to be found by reverse-engineering or (not mentioned in the article) insider knowledge.
