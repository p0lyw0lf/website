Unless you were living under a rock late December 2021, I'm sure you've heard of this vulnerability. Rumored to be discovered by Minecraft script kiddies looking for ways to crash their friend's servers (later proved false), and found to be exploitable nearly everywhere Java ran (thanks to the popularity of Log4J), this was probably the biggest vulnerability of the year. And it needed to get patched during holiday season.
