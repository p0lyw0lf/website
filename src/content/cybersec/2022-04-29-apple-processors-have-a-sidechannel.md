title: Apple Processors Have A Speculation Vulnerability Too

Known as "Augury", this bug can "leak data (pointers) that are never read by
any instruction, even speculatively" thanks to a "microarchitectural
optimization" that is effectively speculation at a deeper level. I'm not fully
sure what some of these words mean but I always find speculation bugs super
fascinating; speed vs security tradeoff is an interesting space to explore.
