This was the mobile background at the time. I think ever since this I have always had PolyWolf art as my desktop/phone bg, which is really cool and also a great motivator for me to get better at art. Both this and the previous image were 'traced' from photos of actual wolves, but artistically converted into polygons. And now u know my name origin story :)
