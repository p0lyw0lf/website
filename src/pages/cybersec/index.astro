  <p>
    This is a list of links that I've been posting to a random Discord channel
    for a cybersecurity class I was in. The server is fairly inactive (but ppl
    still read the channel!) and keeping things exclusively on Discord is bad,
    so I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/crossposter"
      >Discord bot</a
    > that mirrors activity in the channel to this page and a <a
      href="https://infosec.exchange/@PolyWolf">Mastodon account</a
    >.
  </p>
  <ul>
    {
      posts.map((post) => (
        <li>
          <NavLink post={post} />
        </li>
      ))
    }
  </ul>
</Post>
