  <p>NONE OF THIS CONTENT IS MY OWN</p>
  <p>
    This is a list of links that I've been posting to a random Discord channel
    for a cybersecurity class I was in. The server is fairly inactive (but ppl
    still read the channel!) and keeping things exclusively on Discord is bad,
    so I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/crossposter"
      >Discord bot</a
    > that mirrors activity in the channel to this page and a <a
      href="https://infosec.exchange/@PolyWolf">Mastodon account</a
    >.
