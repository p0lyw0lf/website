<Page title="Cybersecurity" {description}>
  <p>NONE OF THIS CONTENT IS MY OWN</p>
  <p>
    This is a list of links that I've been posting to a random Discord channel
    for a cybersecurity class I was in. The server is fairly inactive (but ppl
    still read the channel!) and keeping things exclusively on Discord is bad,
    so I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/crossposter">Discord
    bot</a> that mirrors activity in the channel to this page and a <a
    href="https://infosec.exchange/@PolyWolf">Mastodon account</a>.

          {post.date}: <a href={post.url}>{post.title}</a> (
          <a href={post.direct_link}>source</a>)
        </div>
      ))
