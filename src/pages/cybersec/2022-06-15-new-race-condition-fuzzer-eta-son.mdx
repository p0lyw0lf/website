From [@NedWilliamson](https://twitter.com/nedwilliamson):

> CVE-2022-26757 is my first report using a new technique to find race conditions deterministically. The featured protobuf testcase repros 100% of the time on my internal SockFuzzer branch. I will discuss and open source this technique at Black Hat 2022!
