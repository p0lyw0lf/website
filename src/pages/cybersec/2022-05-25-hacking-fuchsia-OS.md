Written by [Alexander Popov](https://twitter.com/a13xp0p0v), this post goes into
the security model of the Zircon kernel underlying Google's new
[Fuchsia OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuchsia_(operating_system), and an
exploit for it :3

I briefly considered trying to install Fuchsia, but then quickly ran into the 
classic "this build system is only written for Linux get wreckt scrub" i
encounter regularly when running Windows. Maybe now that it's actually running
on real devices I'll try to build it again some day..
