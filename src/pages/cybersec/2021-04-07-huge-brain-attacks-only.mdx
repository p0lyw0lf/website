> Facebook assures us that it's important that your phone number was not stolen from Facebook by hacking. It was stolen by scraping.
>
> For users who try to maintain an unlisted number, the distinction between hacking and scraping might not feel that important. Lots of politicians, celebrities and people with abusive ex-partners had their phone numbers exposed.
>
> How was Facebook scraped? Effectively, the attacker created an address book with every phone number on the planet and then asked Facebook if his ’friends’ are on Facebook.
