> Hey Mac Safari team, I know you're busy getting things ready for Monterey, but can you please fix the bug where Safari crashes when you try to reopen a window that has pinned tabs? I already filed FB9637329, but to make this as easy as possible I've already found the bug for you.

> About halfway down -[BrowserWindowPersistentState initWithBrowserWindowController:encryptionProvider:skipTabStates:] you save the currently selected tab to self->_selectedUnpinnedTabIndex. The index you calculate includes all the pinned tabs...

> ...but at the top of -[BrowserWindowPersistentState restoreWindowContents:] you use this combined index to read from self->_tabStates, which *doesn't* include pinned tabs. Sometimes, you'll just end up selecting the wrong tab, but other times the index will be out of bounds...

> ...and I'm sure you have enough crash reports for this already to recognize what the consequences of that are. Now, I don't have your code in front of me, but perhaps you can fix this by not adding self.currentPinnedTabStates.count to the index when you save it.
