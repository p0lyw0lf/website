From [@mmolgtm](https://twitter.com/mmolgtm):

> This is probably the most complex exploit I've done so far. A UAF in Android kernel freed by kfree_rcu (introduces a delay) in a tight race + kCFI + Samsung RKP. Yet its still possible to gain arbitrary kernel RW, disable SE and root from untrusted app.
