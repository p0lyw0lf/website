  The one where I tried to decide on a name. Because 'PolyWolf' was supposed to be for the older one, but after trying out this Japanese name (bonus points if u can read the Katakana) I decided just to have PolyWolf be my name too :)

    Artfight 2019! This was my first Artfight and I got a lot of good art :)
  </ArtWithDesc>
  <p>...and I don't really want to show any earlier ones since the reference has changed a lot, and I was <em>much</em> worse at art too :P.

  <ArtWithClickthrough src={i2022_10_lean} artist={false}>
    I did this one! Inspired by... certain artists, "non-canon" proportions (esp w/ missing her tail), learned a lot about Procreate (for iPad) in the process of making this.

  <h2>"Original" PolyWolf</h2>
  <p>These are references for the original "PolyWolf" I doodled and decided to make into a username. These pieces have aged much better lol</p>
  <ArtWithDesc images={[{src: i2018_04, title: "it's (young?) me!"}]}>
    mwah. just look at that polygonal goodness. I still absolutely adore this pfp, what a great color scheme and design (if I do say so myself).
  </ArtWithDesc>
  <ArtWithDesc images={[{src: i2017_12_desktop, title: "wowow doin a run"}]}>
    A lot of my newer backgrounds also had this 'thick outline on a solid bg' look, idk what it is but I really like it
  </ArtWithDesc>
  <ArtWithDesc images={[{src: i2017_12_mobile, title: "calm little sit"}]}>
    And this was the mobile background at the time. I think ever since this I have always had PolyWolf art as my desktop/phone bg, which is really cool and also a great motivator for me to get better at art. Both this and the previous image were 'traced' from photos of actual wolves, but artistically converted into polygons. And now u know my name origin story :)
