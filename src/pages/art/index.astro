    And this was the mobile background at the time. I think ever since this I
    have always had PolyWolf art as my desktop/phone bg, which is really cool
    and also a great motivator for me to get better at art. Both this and the
    previous image were 'traced' from photos of actual wolves, but artistically
    converted into polygons. And now u know my name origin story :)
